# Dotted World Map

There is a svg stored in js variable -> see file svg.js. <br>
When a index.html is loaded, then svg is applied to a div in a body of page. <br>
After that function animate() from svg-script.js is called where random circle from 
svg is chosen and custom style (animation, radius of circle and grey color) is added in pages head.<br>
There is also 'animationend' event which is calling the same function after animation has finished.<br>
<img src="screen.gif"/>
